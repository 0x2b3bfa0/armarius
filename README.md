# [Armarius][1]
Updated list of books and magnet links from [epublibre.org](https://epublibre.org). Named after the [scriptorium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptorium) _armarius_, some sort of director who provided the scribes with their materials and supervised the copying process, making sure that all of the monks received books to read.
